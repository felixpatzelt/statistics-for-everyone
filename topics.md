Motivation: why uncertainty matters and how to deal with it
- Skinner - how we behave under uncontrolled uncertainty
- Motivational example: elections - how we could have known

An introductory experiment
- Drawing cards - counts, probabilities, and what do we actually know?
- Repeated experiments
- Error bars

Basic statistics - practical skills
- What is actually a...
    - mean, median, mode
    - standard deviation, standard error
- How to calculate them with pen & pape for small examples

Basic statistics - distributions & the central limit theorem
- Population -> Distribution
- Discrete vs random distributions:
    - Example: Rolling a die vs rounding errors
- The central limit theorem
- Discrete distribution examples:
    - Bernoulli (e.g. flipping a Coin)
    - Binomial (generalisation of Binomial)
    - Discrete Uniform (e.g. Rolling a die)
    - Poisson (Rain drops)
- Continuous Distribution examples:
    - Uniform (rounding errors)
    - Normal (Human height, Sum of random effects)
    - Log Normal (Product of random effects)
    - Exponential 

Basic statistics - deeper explanations
- Binomial & Gaussian Distributions
- Mean of means, or how to detect if the means of two samples are significantly different
- When and why divide by n, n-1, or sqrt(n)

Tests & Power analysis
- T-Test, Binomial Test
- Relation to error bars
- p-value (p-hacking)
- Effect size and why it matters
- How many samples do I need?
- Examples with Excel, Tableau Python

How to perform an experiment
- Correlation vs causation
- The scientific method
- Galileo, gravitational constant (philosophically and historically nice, not essential because drawing cards is already a simple first experiment)
- Random vs systematic errors
- Error propagation
- Data collection and dependencies between observables
- e.g. Trials with two Hospitals, different number of placebos in each hospital and hospital also has an effect.
- Examples with Excel, Tableau, Python

Difficult distributions: 
- Non-Gaussian Distributions
- Skew and Kurtosis
- Quantiles, Box Plots, Median Test

Exeme Events and Self-Similarity
- Diverging moments (why your friends have more friends than you)
- Ranking statistics
- ...
