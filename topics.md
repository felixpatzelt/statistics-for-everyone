Motivation: why uncertainty matters and how to deal with it
- Skinner - how we behave under uncontrolled uncertainty

An introductory experiment
- Drawing cards - counts, probabilities, and what do we actually know?
- Repeated experiments
- Error bars
- Checkout motivational example: elections - how we could have known

Basic statistics - practical skills
- What is actually a...
    - mean, median, mode
    - standard deviation, standard error
    - median and quantile
- How to calculate them with pen & pape for small examples
- Appendix: how to calculate the standard quantities in Excel, Tableau, Python

Basic statistics - deeper explanations
- Binomial & Gaussian Distributions
- Mean of means, or how to detect if the means of two samples are significantly different
- When and why divide by n, n-1, or sqrt(n)

Tests & Power analysis
- T-Test, Binomial Test, Median Test
- Relation to error bars
- p-value (p-hacking)
- Effect size and why it matters
- How many samples do I need?
- Examples with Excel, Tableau Python

How to perform an experiment.
- Random vs systematic errors
- Data collection and dependencies between observables
- e.g. Trials with two Hospitals, different number of placebos in each hospital and hospital also has an effect.
- Galileo, gravitational constant (philosophically and historically nice, not essential because drawing cards is already a simple first experiment)
- Error propagation
- Examples with Excel, Tableau, Python

Difficult distributions: 
- Non-Gaussian Distributions
- Skew and Kurtosis

Exeme Events and Self-Similarity
- Diverging moments (why your friends have more friends than you)
- Ranking statistics
- ...
